This file - repository, contains the semester project of Computational Geometry Course, 
Department of Informatics, University of Piraeus (2021 - 2022), under the supervision of
Dr. K. Manes. 

For a given set of line segments and points in plane, the main task, is the calculation 
of the Convex Hull of the plane point set, as well as the implementation and analysis
of the 4 point - location algorithmic techiques provided by C.G.A.L. Library.
